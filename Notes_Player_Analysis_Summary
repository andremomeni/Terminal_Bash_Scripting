We have reason to believe that the player colluding with the internal dealer is Mylie Schmidt. She appeared 13 times within 03/10-03/15 time frame. The dealer we believe is working with Mylie Schmit is Billy Jones. He appeared on the days of the losses along with the same times in which Mylie Schmidt was at the Roulette tables.
